## VICREO Hotkey Listener

A Companion module for controlling VICREO Hotkey Listener - enables remote keyboard automation and hotkey simulation for broadcast, live streaming, and production environments.

### About

This module connects to the VICREO Listener application to send keyboard commands, hotkey combinations, and mouse actions to remote computers. VICREO Listener is a small program that sits on your machine waiting for incoming TCP connection/commands. It uses pre-defined commands to simulate key-presses on your machine. You can use this program to perform hotkey actions from remote.

### Requirements

- VICREO Listener application installed on target machine
- Network connectivity between Companion and target machine
- For advanced features (mouse actions, shell commands, etc.), a VICREO license is required

## Usage

Download and run the application on the remote computer (local is also possible). In companion, fill in the IP address of the remote computer or 127.0.0.1 if installed on the same machine.

### Open a file

Goto presets and drag-drop [Open Notepad]. This will give you the right example how to do this.

### TIPS for MacOS

For mac, when you need the path of a file, right-click on the file and when you see the menu, press and hold Alt to be able to copy the full path.

When using Powerpoint for mac, you can program a goto slide via a process. Use the 'Send KeyPress To MacOS Process' action and fill the process name (in this case Microsoft Powerpoint, you can search for it in activity monitor on the mac) and select the desired key. For example ANSI_3. Then use a bit delay (30ms) on the same button for the ANSI_KeypadEnter.

> > When using file paths make sure you put " around the path, like: "filepath"

### TIPS for Windows

For Windows, when you need to open a file, right-click on the file while pressing Shift, to be able to copy the full path. Leave it all as it is (wrong slashes and ")
There is an example preset to open notepad.

### Mouse Position and click

From version 4.0.10 upwards there is control over the mouse via position and a click (left, right, middle button, double click)
